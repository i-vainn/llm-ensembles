The code is also repetitive and contains many unnecessary lines of code that do not contribute to the solution. The answer lacks proper comments and explanations, making it difficult to understand the logic behind the code.\n\nAssistant 2's answer implements a binary search algorithm using Python. The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear comments explaining the logic behind each step. However, the implementation is not entirely correct, as the code does not handle the case where the value is not present in the array.
