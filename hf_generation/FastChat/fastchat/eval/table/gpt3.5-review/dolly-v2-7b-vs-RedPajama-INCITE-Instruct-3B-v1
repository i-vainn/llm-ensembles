The code is efficient and implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The comments are clear and concise, explaining the logic and functionality of the code. However, the base case for Fibonacci(2) should be 1 instead of 2, as the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.\n\nAssistant 2's submission is not as strong as Assistant 1's.
