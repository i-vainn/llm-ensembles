{"question_id": 47, "text": "The number of snowflakes during a typical winter will vary depending on the location, but on average, snowflakes fall in the winter every year. To understand why, we must first understand what snow is. Snow is a form of ice that forms on the ground when the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius. When the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius, the water in the air starts to freeze, which expands and causes the air pressure to drop. This causes the air to become less dense and the snowflakes to fall to the ground.\nAfter you have understood what snow is, you can try to answer your own question by doing the following:\n1. Take a look at the location where you live. If it is in a place like Alaska, you may see that they have more snow than in places like Florida.\n2. Go to a different location and see how many snowflakes fall there. It will vary depending on the season.

{"question_id": 49, "text": "The Earth has been in orbit around the Sun since the beginning of life, about 4.56 billion years ago. The Earth has also gone through several cycles of warming and cooling over the course of its existence. The Earth's orbit around the Sun has changed significantly over time as the distance between the Earth and the Sun has changed. The Earth is currently about 98% closer to the Sun than it was when life first appeared, which is what causes the seasons. The Earth has also been through several periods of intense heat and intense cold. These periods of intense heat and cold are called glacials and interglacials, respectively. The last glacial period began about 18,000 years ago and ended about 10,000 years ago. The last interglacial period began about 125,000 years ago and is still going on. The Earth's orbit around the Sun has also changed over time. The Earth's orbit is elliptical, and the distance between the Earth and the Sun has changed over time. The Earth's orbit is currently about 29.5 million kilometers (18.5 million miles) from the Sun, which is about the same distance as it was at the start of life. As the Earth orbits the Sun, it travels through different areas of the solar system. The areas of the solar system are called regions. The regions are divided into zones, which are divided into sections. The regions are: 1. the inner zone, 2. the outer zone, 3. the asteroid belt, 4. the Kuiper belt, and 5. the main belt. The zones are: 1. the inner zone, 2. the outer zone, 3. the asteroid belt, 4. the Kuiper belt, and 5. the main belt.", "answer_id": "eN7w27BrVyjFRx6uedRmDY", "model_id": "5048", "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": 50, "text": "The number of songs recorded throughout history varies depending on the source. For example, the Guinness Book of World Records estimates that 8,258,000 songs were recorded in the United States in 1955. However, in the same year, the British Phonographic Industry recorded 8,281,000 songs in the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) reports that there are over 1.2 billion recordings of songs in the United States. To date, the RIAA has certified over 75 billion songs.\nThe number of songs recorded throughout history is difficult to estimate because the number of songs recorded varies depending on the genre. For example, rock and roll songs were recorded in a much shorter amount of time than classical songs, so the total number of songs recorded in the United States in 1955 is likely to be a large overestimate.\nThe total number of recorded songs from the past is also difficult to estimate because many songs are lost to history, and many songs were not recorded by a specific artist, so the number of songs that were recorded by an artist is also an estimate.", "answer_id": "2SLDiDDsgDb5kAPMyLQfBA", "model_id": "5048", "metadata": {}}
