{"question_id": 62, "text": "Many different programs have been developed to find the longest common subsequence of two strings in Python. In this example, we will use the dynamic programming algorithm to find the longest common subsequence of two strings. To use the dynamic programming algorithm, we need to use the following functions:\n1. longest_common: This function finds the longest common subsequence of two strings. This function accepts two strings as input and returns the length of the longest common subsequence in the two input strings.\n2. longest_common_fast: This function is nearly identical to the above function except that it takes advantage of the fact that the length of the longest common subsequence is a function of the length of the smaller string.\n3. most_common: This function finds the most common subsequence of two strings.
