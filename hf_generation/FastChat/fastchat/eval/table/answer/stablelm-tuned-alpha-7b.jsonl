{"question_id": 45, "text": "The global average rate of deforestation is 1.2 billion hectares per year. Assuming that deforestation occurs in the Amazon rainforest, how many trees are destroyed each year?\n\nAnswer: According to the UN, the global deforestation rate is around 1.5 billion hectares per year. We can start by using this value to convert the annual rate of deforestation into a rate per year.\n\nFor example, if the deforestation rate is 1,200 hectares per year, then the annual rate of deforestation is 200 hectares per year. We can then convert this into hectares of forest per year using the following formula:\n\nhectare per year = (annual rate of deforestation) x (number of years)\n\nUsing this value, we can calculate the number of trees destroyed per year.\n\nFor example, if the deforestation rate is 1,200 hectares per year, the annual rate of deforestation is 200 hectares per year, and the forest land area is 20,000 hectares in a year, then the number of trees destroyed per year is:\n\nnumber of trees destroyed per year = (1,200 hectares per year) x (20,000 hectares per year) = 40,000 trees per year\n\nTherefore, the global average rate of deforestation is approximately 40,000 trees per year.", "answer_id": "dmeESWYSaJXH5izY47TAKA", "model_id": "1685", "metadata": {}}

The plague, which killed between 30% and 40% of the European population, had a profound impact on the social, economic, and political structures of medieval Europe.\n1. Impact: The Black Death significantly reduced the population of Europe, leading to a decline in agriculture and trade. The plague also marked the rise of feudalism, as many nobles lost their peasants to the plague. The plague also had a significant impact on the medical and scientific communities, as it led to a decline in the ability of medicine to fight the disease.\n2. Consequences: A significant portion of the population was left homeless, leading to long-term poverty and social inequality. The plague also caused a decline in the population's birth rate, which in turn contributed to a decline in population growth.\n3. Recovery: The plague was eventually eradicated by the Catholic Church and did not have a lasting impact on the population.
