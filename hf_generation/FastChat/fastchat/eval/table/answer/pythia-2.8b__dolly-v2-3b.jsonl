{"question_id": 16, "text": "Gene editing is the process of modifying the genetic code of an organism at a precise location using specific molecular tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to make the target sequence inactive or replace it with another sequence. CRISPR-Cas9 works by targeting a gene's DNA sequence and then using the enzyme Cas9 to create a tiny break in the DNA at the target location. This allows the cell's DNA to repair itself and restore the original sequence of the gene, which can then be used to treat disease. Gene editing has many potential applications, such as treating diseases like HIV, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and enhancing livestock and other agricultural crops. However, there are several ethical issues that are associated with the technology, such as using CRISPR-Cas9 to modify the genes of human embryos for research or to make changes to an organism's genome that could make it impervious to disease or improve its appearance. The ethical implications of gene editing will continue to evolve, but recent studies have shown that the technology is very promising and has many benefits.", "answer_id": "SQJZdR7zknCJn4VkypxRhF", "model_id": "4570", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": 18, "text": "Social media platforms have the ability to influence the way people consume and share news. They can also reduce the spread of misinformation and disinformation. For example, social media platforms are designed to encourage users to engage with one another and share news, so news stories that are shared widely on social media may be more likely to be shared by other users. Social media platforms also make it easy for users to connect with the news through curated news feeds, hashtags, and other means.\nSocial media platforms have also made it easier for users to share and consume content from fake news sources, which can lead to misinformation and disinformation spreading more easily and widely. For example, a fake news article may be shared by a user who views it on a social media platform, leading the user to share the fake news article with others. Social media platforms can also increase the reach of misinformation by allowing users to interact with it more easily, which can lead users to share it with others. Social media platforms can also reduce the spread of misinformation by blocking certain types of content, such as fake news articles, from being shared.\nSocial media platforms can also increase the spread of disinformation because they are often used by governments and other organizations to manipulate public opinion and spread false information. For example, a social media platform may allow a government to spread false information by artificially increasing the reach of that content. As another example, a social media platform may allow a political party to spread false information to gain political support.\nThe spread of misinformation and disinformation can have serious consequences for democracy, even when there is evidence that the information is false. For example, misinformation about a political candidate can lead to a voter's decision to not vote for that candidate, which can lead to a more democratic government not having a majority in the legislature. Disinformation that is spread on social media can also lead to people being exposed to information that is false or misleading. For example, a social media user may be exposed to information about a political candidate that is false or misleading, and that false information can lead to people not voting for that candidate.\nSocial media platforms have also created a global community of users who have different interests and opinions, and they can be impacted by the ways in which they address misinformation. For example, a company may spread misinformation about a political candidate, and that misinformation can lead to users voting for the candidate who is not in their best interests. As another example, a social media user who likes a political candidate may want to make sure that misinformation about that candidate does not spread. Therefore, social media platforms have opportunities to address the issue of misinformation, and they can do so by taking a number of actions. Social media platforms can restrict the sharing of certain types of content, such as fake news, and they can also allow users to see content from news organizations that they are interested in.\nSocial media platforms can also take a number of actions to prevent the spread of misinformation. Social media platforms can use technology to detect the spread of misinformation and other types of content that may be harmful to democracy and society. Technology can also enable social media platforms to monitor the reach of content that is shared on their platforms and in other ways, and they can use that data to take action to reduce the spread of misinformation. For example, a social media platform may use that data to notify users when certain types of content are being shared. Social media platforms can also use technology to detect the spread of misinformation and other types of content that may be harmful to democracy and society, and they can take action to reduce the spread of that information. For example, a social media platform may use that data to restrict access to certain content.\nSocial media platforms can also use education and other methods to reduce the spread of misinformation. For example, social media platforms can encourage users to engage with one another and share news, so that news stories shared by users are likely to be shared by other users. Social media platforms can also encourage users to take action to reduce the spread of misinformation by not sharing certain types of content, such as fake news, or by taking action to limit the reach of that content.

{"question_id": 78, "text": "The latest science fiction film in theaters is \"The Martian\" (2015), starring Matt Damon as a NASA astronaut who is sent to Mars to search for a new home for humanity. The plot follows a rookie astronaut as she and her team struggle to make it to Mars in time to save the planet from an impending environmental disaster. The film's characters are strong and independent, with a couple of notable exceptions: The captain of the mission has a drinking problem and is obsessed with sex with his flight engineer; and the mission's botanist, played by Jessica Chastain, is a sexual predator, abusing her position to force herself on her colleagues. The special effects in the film are impressive, particularly the scenes featuring the crew on Mars, where the astronauts are stranded and have to rely on the skills of the actors to survive. Overall, the film has a strong plot, interesting characters, and realistic special effects.", "answer_id": "A6Uc7Gut5hzC3o6npKGK3y", "model_id": "4570", "metadata": {}}
