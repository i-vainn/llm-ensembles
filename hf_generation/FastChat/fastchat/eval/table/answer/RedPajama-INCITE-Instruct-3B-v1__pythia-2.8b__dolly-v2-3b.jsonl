{"question_id": 5, "text": "Quantum computing is a form of computation that uses the laws of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. It's a relatively new concept that hasn't been widely used yet, but it promises to be more powerful than traditional computing. Quantum computing is also known as quantum information processing. Here are some key facts about quantum computing:\n1. Quantum computers are built from quantum bits, or qubits. A qubit can exist in a superposition of two states, which gives it the ability to process information. In contrast, a classical bit can only be in one state, 0 or 1.\n2. Quantum bits are much smaller than traditional bits, which allows them to process exponentially more information than traditional bits. This means that a quantum computer can perform much more complex calculations than a classical computer.\n3. Quantum computers are also much faster than classical computers. This is because they can process information more quickly, and because they can perform many calculations simultaneously.\n4. Because quantum bits are so small, they can be entangled. Entanglement is when two separate particles become correlated in such a way that their state cannot be determined independently of each other.\n5. Quantum computing can be used to carry out tasks that are too complex for a classical computer. For example, it can be used to perform calculations for which a classical computer would require too many calculations to complete.\n6. Quantum computers are also less prone to error in the calculations. This is because quantum bits are more susceptible to interference from other particles than are classical bits.", "answer_id": "5vAYvGgxs2ETUCToCsdwFp", "model_id": "4473", "metadata": {}}

{"question_id": 78, "text": "The film is set in the far future, when the world has become a dystopian wasteland. The main character, called 'M', is a former 'robot' who was programmed to look human and live a human lifestyle. He is now a prisoner in a small subterranean prison, where he is forced to serve the \"Master\" of the prison, a villainous, sadistic, and seemingly unstoppable being who is worshipped by most of the other prisoners. The film shows the Master's cruelty and sadism, and includes a huge number of special effects, including a lot of CGI, which add to the film's overall visual appeal. The main character is an intelligent and resourceful figure, and his attempts to escape from the Master's clutches are inspiring and exciting. The main character is also a skilled fighter, and is able to kill a number of the Master's henchmen, although he does not kill the Master himself. The film's plot is very complex, with many different characters and storylines, but the main theme is the Master's quest for power and domination. The Master is trying to create an army of robots who will serve him and do his bidding. M is a good and heroic character, but he is not the main focus of the film's plot. The main character's story is ultimately not very interesting, and the film would have been better without him. The film does a good job of showing the Master's sadism and cruelty, and it is clear that he is a villain of sorts. The special effects are extremely well done, and the film's visual appeal is very high. The film's score is also very good.
